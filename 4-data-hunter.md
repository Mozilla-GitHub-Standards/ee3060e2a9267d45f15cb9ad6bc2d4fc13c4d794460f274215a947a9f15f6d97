# Becoming a Data Hunter: A Primer

## Greetings.

So youâ€™re interested in working with data produced by other people. Awesome! There are [lots](https://search.dataone.org/index.html#data) [of](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) [data](http://www.ands.org.au/) out there, waiting to be reused, combined with other datasets, or used differently. Some people refer to this as secondary data analysis. This approach can be a great way to expand the scope of your research, answer questions at a bigger spatial or temporal scale, gain insights into how other systems work, test your ideas in different places, and build collaborations. This primer is designed to help get you started.
