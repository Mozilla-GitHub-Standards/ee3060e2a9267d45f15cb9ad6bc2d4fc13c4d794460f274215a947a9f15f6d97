<p>These reasons look good on paper, on but what does deciding to share-- or deciding not to share-- your data look like in real life? Here&#x2019;s a recent example of open data in action.</p>
<p>When an outbreak of the previously rare Zika Virus Disease emerged in South America in early 2015, it was clear that the threat to public health was-- and remains-- urgent. Researchers in David O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s lab at the University of Wisconsin, Madison decided that the epidemic, which may lead to devastating birth defects in babies born to infected women, called for a new level of collaboration. He decided to release real-time, day by day results of his studies on the effects of Zika on Macaque monkeys, rather than waiting months (or years) for the results of his work to be published in a traditional journal. By releasing both his data and findings online, O&#x2019;Connor invited international collaboration. Researchers from around the world downloaded and reviewed the data, made comments, provided advice, and even offered to lend expertise and equipment to run tests that O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s lab wasn&#x2019;t equipped to perform. Studies are still underway, but it&#x2019;s likely that opening this data-- and creating connections among researchers globally --  will aid efforts to understand and combat Zika.

<p>The Zika story shows how open data might help speed scientific discovery and improve research practice. See below for more stories that support each of our six reasons to open your data. </p>
<p><strong>Maintain Integrity.</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, two Economics professors from Harvard published a paper on economic policy that was widely publicized and very influential during a time of global economic instability. In 2013, University of Massachusetts researchers were unable to replicate the results of this study; they requested the data set from the original authors and discovered coding errors, data omissions, and unconventional methods of analysis that call into question the validity of the original conclusion. <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/22/reinhart-rogoff-revisited-why-we-need-open-data-in-economics/" target="_blank">Read more about this case here</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Speed Discovery.</strong> </p>
<p>In the early 2000s, two competing research projects, the Human Genome Project (HGP) and efforts by biotech company Celera, worked to sequence the human genome. HGP put all of its data in the public domain, while Celera tried to patent its findings.  A 2013 study by an MIT economist shows HGP&#x2019;s open data generated more knowledge and innovation (as measured by publications and the development of diagnostic tests) than Celera&#x2019;s patented sequences. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130403/09501122561/public-domain-human-genome-project-generated-more-research-more-commercial-activity-than-proprietary-competitor.shtml" target="_blank">Learn more about the study here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Encourage collaboration across disciplines.</strong></p>
<p>The Midwestern U.S. is known as the &#x201C;country&#x2019;s breadbasket&#x201D;-- a major food producing region for that nation. Climate change is expected to affect production in coming decades, possibly dramatically. Agricultural scientists, meteorologists, and climate modelers all gather or generate data separately that, when pieced together, may provide a comprehensive understanding of these effects, but data and findings are rarely shared across disciplines. In <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/10/biosci.biv164.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">a 2015 article</a>, a group of scientists from disparate disciplines laid out a plan to share and use data across a network of research sites, in order to create better climate models and apply data from models to the design of mitigation and adaptation strategies. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-bread-basket-shifts-thanks-to-climate-change/" target="_blank">Learn more about the network here.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Solve a broader range of problems.</strong></p>
<p>Australia&#x2019;s Oznome Project aims to amass all available data on that nation&#x2019;s economy, infrastructure, agriculture, public health, energy and water systems, and more into one centralized, accessible database. The name &#x201C;Oznome&#x201D; is a hat-tip to the Human Genome project, the effort to gather data on every single gene in the human genome. By 2025, Oznome aspires to be just as comprehensive, creating a &#x201C;historical, current and future digital representation of everything&#x201D; in Australia.  Linking diverse data sets will allow researchers to explore the relationships between systems to anticipate and solve problems that may not have been apparent in a single data set. And tackling problems of compatibility across diverse data sets, while daunting, may lead to better, richer predictive models as well as lower costs associated with data discovery, access and preparation. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076539-australias-plan-to-make-a-digital-representation-of-everything/" target="_blank">Learn more about the Oznome project.</a></p>
<p><strong>Encourage public engagement with research.</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, a Dutch schoolteacher was browsing through images from the Hubble space telescope, made freely available online via the platform Galaxy Zoo. The teacher spotted a glowing green cloud floating next to a distant galaxy, and alerted researchers to her discovery. Galaxy Zoo is a project of Zooniverse, a platform for participatory research that invites the public to study objects or artifacts collected in research, and answer simple questions about them. The platform enables analysis of large data sets by crowdsourcing this work to human volunteers, who provide results that are superior to pattern recognition algorithms. On the Zooniverse platform, volunteers and researchers engage, discuss results, and even make significant discoveries together. That Dutch schoolteacher&#x2019;s glowing cloud turned out to be a new kind of celestial object, produced by dust from ancient galactic collisions interacting with black holes. Working together, researchers and citizen scientists have since found 19 more of these objects, known as Hanny&#x2019;s Voorwerpjes (&#x201C;Hanny&#x2019;s Objects,&#x201D; in Dutch).

<p><strong>Ensure that data is preserved.</strong> </p>
<p>In 1969, when the United States Apollo 11 mission brought the first humans to the moon, the astronauts recorded their historic spacewalk using a special lunar camera and unique film format. Images were beamed back to earth, converted to a broadcast-friendly format, and shown live on TV screens around the globe. The now-familiar footage of those first steps is actually a significantly degraded version of the original, due to conversion from the lunar camera&#x2019;s special format. Almost 40 years later, engineers decided to apply 21st century imaging technology to the original footage, to see if a crisper, higher resolution dub was possible. NASA tried to locate the master magnetic tapes but they&#x2019;d gone missing. Following an epic search through the organization&#x2019;s massive archives, officials concluded that the original moon landing footage was recorded over with satellite footage captured sometime in the 1980s, during a period when the agency was short on magnetic tape. Fortunately, media agencies worldwide archived the 1969 broadcast so the historical record, albeit low-resolution, endures. Engineers were able make an <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11_hdpage.html" target="_blank">HD restoration of the footage</a> by compiling all available archived versions.
