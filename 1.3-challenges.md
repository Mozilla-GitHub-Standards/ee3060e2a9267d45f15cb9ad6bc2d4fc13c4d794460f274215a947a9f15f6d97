#OK, open data sounds great, but...

You’ve probably already heard some counter-arguments to open data and you may have a few lingering questions yourself. Here are three of the most frequently voiced challenges to open data, and our answers to them.  

**“I’ll be scooped! Someone could discover something amazing in my data before I have a chance publish.”**  
Of course, you want to get as much as you can out of the data you collect and maintain. However, when you make data publicly available, you’re letting everyone know that you did it first.  Open data is the ultimate security: no one can steal what has been freely shared.

**“Documenting my data so someone else can understand it is too complicated. Who has time?”**  
Actually, documenting your data isn’t just good for science and collective human knowledge-- it’s good for you, as a researcher, too. Any time spent adding context and meta-information to your data now will save you hours and hours of trying to decipher your research a year or two or ten years down the road.  Spend a half an hour writing up a [Data Reuse Plan](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/data_reuse/). Other researchers-- and your future self-- will thank you for it!

**“I’m worried that someone will find mistakes in my data/analysis…”**  
Of course it's embarrassing to discover that you made a mistake, but it's better to find out quickly. Opening up your data before publishing gives others the opportunity to help you out before you have to issue a retraction. Unrecognized mistakes that do make it into the literature cause people to waste time/effort/money following up on ideas based on false premises– and the person most likely to follow up on your conclusions is you. Open data can also prove that your mistake was honest; if the data is open, there is a risk that people might doubt your ability, but they can't doubt your integrity.

**“It’s so confusing! I don’t know where to start.”**  
We’re here to help! And you don’t have to do all at once. There are lots of simple ways to get started, and we’ve outlined them in the second primer in this series, [How to Open Your Data](https://github.com/mozillascience/open-data-primers/blob/master/2-how-to.md). Take a look and see if there are one or two best practices you can incorporate into your workflow now.
