#Why Does Mozilla <3 Open Data?
The idea of open data is nothing new, but has gained popularity with the rise of the World Wide Web. Home to countless online communities it has allowed people from around the world to freely and asynchronously share and discuss content and ideas. The technology has already transformed nearly every sphere of our lives… and it has the potential to do much more. 

This Open Data Primer was produced by Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser. Why Mozilla? Well, Firefox is open source, meaning the project’s code is freely available online for anyone to use and reuse, and the project invites participation and collaboration from all.  At Mozilla, we recognize that the web is an awesome tool for creation and collaboration, a space where people can find each other, communicate, and work together. **We’re convinced we can use the web, emerging technologies, and open practices to do better research.** To learn more, check out [Mozilla’s Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) program. We offer [trainings](https://science.mozilla.org/resources) and [support communities of people](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) working with and for open data, open science, and open research in all fields.
