Take a few minutes to watch the video linked above.  Were you able to relate to the story?

A key component of making your data open is sharing it.  Historically, because of technological constraints, all the information shared from a research project was published in written summary form, whether it was a book, an article, or a thesis. Unfortunately, these written summaries inherently leave out many of the details of the scientific process. Thankfully, in recent years there has been a shift in that thinking and the idea that the research data can be just as important as, if not more than, the resulting publication.  Similarly, we’ve been seeing a shift around the release of government data, on the local level as well as federal.

We have seen this shift taking place through changes in [funder](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/datapolicy/) [policies](http://sparcopen.org/our-work/research-data-sharing-policy-initiative/funder-policies/), [government](https://www.opendata.go.ke/) [initiatives](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/ostp/initiatives#Openness), and the development of [institutional](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc), [national](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), [disciplinary](http://datadryad.org/), and other types of data repositories to host data.

Sharing your data requires more than just saving your data to a publicly available website.  In previous primers we’ve discussed [why](1-open-data-what.md) and [how](2-how-to.md) to make your data reusable.  In this primer, we’ll show you how to share that reusable data.
