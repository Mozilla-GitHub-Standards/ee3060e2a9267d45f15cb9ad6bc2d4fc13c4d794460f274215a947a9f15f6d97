# Making Friends With Other People’s Data: A Primer

## Hey there.

Let's recap what we've done so far.

You've learned:
* [what open data is and why it's important](1-open-data-what.md),
* [how to make your own data open](2-how-to.md),
* [how and where to share your open data](3-sharing-data.md), and
* [how and where to find other people's open data](4-data-hunter.md).

This is where we pull it all together and come full circle to talk about how to work with data you didn't create and use it in your own research.
