# Converting File Formats

As was mentioned in [Primer 2](2-how-to.md), the data you'd like to use can come in any number of formats.  The format in which you receive it will not necessarily be in a format you can use.  Don't despair!  Thankfully, many file formats can be converted into other formats that can (hopefully) work with the platforms you use.

**First, be sure to fully understand the file format in which the data was produced or stored.** Even common proprietary formats can cause interpretation issues. For example, [Microsoft Excel is notorious in the data science community for how it handles date data](https://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/04/10/abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-dates-in-excel/).  If the data is preserved in a proprietary or uncommon format the best thing to do is to **preserve a copy of the original**. This will avoid data loss and give you something to go back to in case the file conversion gets tricky.

**Second, look for a tool to handle conversion of the file format** to that being used by the platforms you are using for data analysis, such as [rio](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html) for R.  Sometimes the software or platform you are using will have an conversion utility built in, usually found in the "File" menu under "Import" or "Export".

**Finally, save your newly converted file in a simple, non-proprietary format**, such as .csv for tabular data.  For more information on non-proprietary formats, see [Primer 2: File Formats, FTW](2.4-file-formats.md)!
