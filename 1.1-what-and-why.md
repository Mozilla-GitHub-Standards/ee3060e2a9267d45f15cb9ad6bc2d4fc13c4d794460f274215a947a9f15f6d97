#Why Open Data? 

Open Data helps to: 

##1.  Maintain Accountability 
When data is open, the results or findings of that data can be more easily verified, increasing public trust in research institutions and governments.  

##2.  Speed Discovery
When data is open, researchers working in parallel on similar problems don’t need to duplicate work and can use each other’s data to advance knowledge across their research area. 

##3.  Encourage collaboration across disciplines
When data is open, researchers can more easily find those outside their subject area doing related or relevant work; these connections and collaborations may lead to new ways of approaching and solving problems.
 
##4.  Solve a broader range of problems
When data is open, new users-- from academic researchers to citizen scientists to artists-- may use it to answer questions, solve problems, or create public understanding in ways that the original data collector may never have imagined.   

##5.  Encourage public engagement with research
When data is open and the findings are shared in a clear and accessible way, it increases public understanding, creates opportunities for public participation, and bolsters public support of research initiatives.  
 
##6.  Ensure that data is preserved 
When data is open and widely shared, the responsibility for the long-term archiving and preservation of that data is distributed across broader group of interested users.
